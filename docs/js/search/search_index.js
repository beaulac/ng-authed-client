NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AuthedClientModule } from 'ng-authed-client';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    AuthedClientModule.forRoot()\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}Finally use in one of your apps components:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  template: ''\n})\nexport class MyComponent {}You may also find it useful to view the demo source.\nDocumentation\nAll documentation is auto-generated from the source via compodoc and can be viewed here:\nhttps://beaulac.github.io/ng-authed-client/docs/\nDevelopment\nPrepare your environment\n\nInstall Node.js and yarn\nInstall local dev dependencies: yarn while current directory is this repo\n\nDevelopment server\nRun yarn start to start a development server on port 8000 with auto reload + tests.\nTesting\nRun yarn test to run tests once or yarn run test:watch to continually run tests.\nRelease\n\nBump the version in package.json (once the module hits 1.0 this will become automatic)yarn run release\n\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
